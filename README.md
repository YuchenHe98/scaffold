# scaffold

## Setup

To set up a Python virtual environment for this project:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.scaffold
source ~/.scaffold/bin/activate
```

Itâ€™s conventional to name the virtual environment the same as the repository name. After activating the environment, verify that python and pip point to the correct paths:

```bash
which python
which pip
```

They should output paths like:

```bash
/home/your-user/.scaffold/bin/python
/home/your-user/.scaffold/bin/pip
```
